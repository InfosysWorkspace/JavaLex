Choose the right collection based on the requirement to improve performance. Some of the points to be considered are:

If duplicate elements are not allowed to choose Set otherwise choose List.

ArrayList is quicker than LinkedList to randomly access elements.

For quick removal and addition, LinkedList is better than ArrayList.

Use collections such as TreeMap, TreeSet when elements in the collection are required to be sorted and ordered.

Use concurrent collections to support concurrent access.
